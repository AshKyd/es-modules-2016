    <h2>AMD</h2>
<pre class="">
define('myModule', ['jquery'], function($){
    return function(){};
});
</pre>
<!--
AMD modules are asynchronous and utilise a callback style approach. This is
similar to how jsonp works, sending a payload to a named function, except in
this case the payload specifies a namespace.
-->
<div class="fragment">
    <h2>CommonJS</h2>
<pre>
var $ = require('jquery');
module.exports = function(){};
</pre>
</div>

<div class="fragment">
<!--
CommonJS was popularised by Node and is a synchronous require statement. Because
of the synchronous nature of the require call, this is not suitable in browser
environments, and needs to be compiled/transpiled with something like Webpack
or Browserify.

export { variable1 as name1, variable2 as name2, …, nameN };
export let name1, name2, …, nameN; // also var
export let name1 = …, name2 = …, …, nameN; // also var, const

export default expression;
export default function (…) { … } // also class, function*

export { import1 as name1, import2 as name2, …, nameN } from …;
</pre>
</section>
<!--
There are a bunch of export types as you can see here from the examples
One of the biggest differences that I've noticed is you can have multiple
exports. CommonJS as with functions will only ever return one output. It may be
an object, but it's still one thing.
ES modules can export any numberr of things, and these things can be imported
to your code separately.

<section>
    <h2>Babel</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Converts ES* to ES5</li>
        <li>Often used with Webpack</li>
        <li>Wide compatibility</li>
    </ul>
<!--
    Babel is probably the most used ES6 tool of today. Most of you have probably
    heard of it, but if you haven't it transpiles ES2015 to ES5 which regular
    browsers can undesrtand. This is awesome if you need to support stuff like
    IE9, or if you want to use bleeding edge features, but it's still a
    transpiler so it suffers all the same drawbacks as TypeScript and
    Coffeescript around build time and debugging.
    That being said, this is probably the most common choice right now for big
    projects, and isn't going away any time soon (by design). The babel project
    plans to stick around as long as the ES spec is in motion.
-->
</section>
<section>
    <h2>Rollup</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bundles all imports together</li>
        <li>Leaves pure ES2015</li>
        <li>Does one thing well</li>
    </ul>
<!--
    Rollup is an ES2015 module bundler, it takes your ES2015 code and bundles
    it into the one file leaving the rest of the code untouched. This
    effectively leaves your beautiful ES2015 code for browsers that can handle
    it, but with don't have module loading support yet.
    It's the ultimate "do one thing well" tool, as it doesn't support extraneous
    features like Babel. It bundles your modules, does a bit of optimisation,
    and that's it. It's very nice in that regard.
    It's probably one fo the more forward-thinking tools, because it
    requires no transpiling or non-standard features. All the code you write is
    proper gold certified ES6 and will continue working into the future.
-->
</section>
<section>
    <h2>SystemJS + JSPM</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Loads all the module formats (ES, CommonJS)</li>
        <li>Based on WhatWG loader spec</li>
        <li>Mandatory transpile :(</li>
    </ul>
<!--
    Best of both worlds, lets you use old style & new style modules with the one
    loader. Includes an API based on the ES module loading draft and
    supports async module loading with promises. Of the old gods this aligns
    it closer to RequireJS than CommonJS in that you can dynamically pull in
    code when you need it rather than load everything on page load.
    Like Babel, this is more of a lifestyle choice in that once you start
    writing SystemJS code you're going to be somewhat stuck with it or at least
    potentially have a refactor on your hands when the ES spec finalises.

</code></pre>
</section>
<!--
The other interesting approach is SystemJS which is based on the ES loader
polyfill which attempts to implement the WahtWG loader spec. That said, this
is way more than a polyfill, it's a thing that stands on its own, and lets you
load pretty much any type of module with an async loading approach.
This is especially useful for on the client where you might need to lazy load
bits of your app as you go, and was a constant problem at my old job where we
had a big ol' monolithic codebase and wanted to add heavy new features.
As you can see, it's a code-based solution, which uses promises to call back
when the module is loaded. In this exmaple I'm loading the module and
then printing the hello world from the library that was returned. I've also
added a catch because promises swallow errors and can be paiiinful to debug.

</section>
<!--
JSPM is another interesting development, and is basically a wrapper on top of
SystemJS. Essentially it wraps NPM and GitHub to provide an ES6 friendly package
manager independent of NPM itself. I believe Aurelia uses JSPM for package
management.
I'm not sure I'm a big fan of this to be honest, because it sort of
feels a bit like a duplication of effort but let's have a poke around a JSPM
project and see what it does.

        "prepublish": "rollup index.js > bundle.js"
    }
}
</code></pre>
</section>
<!--
So that's all well and good, but how do ES modules fit into the current ecosystem.
Answer: we're still back to precompiling unfortunately. CommonJS is the standard
for NPM modules, so we can use our favourite transpiler (babel, rollup, webpack
or whatever to distribute a compatible ES5/CommonJS module that the rest of the)
world can consume.
You can pretty easily do this by adding a prepublish script to your package.json
which builds the CommonJS prior to publication. By setting the "main" attribute
to the compiled version, anything that pulls this module in will use the CJS
version by default.
Seems like a bit of a waste? Kinda is. But...

<section id="jsnextmain">
    <h2>Make it native</h2>
    <p>~proposed~ feature</p>
<pre><code>{
    "main": "bundle.js",
    "jsnext:main": "index.js",
    "scripts": {
        "prepublish": "rollup index.js > bundle.js"
    }
}
</code></pre>
</section>
<!--
The jsnext:main property is a proposal championed by Rich Harris and Rollup,
which essentially supersedes the main property in your package.json. The idea is
that any compatible bundlers or engines can use the native source code rather
than the tranpiled source code which gives efficiency gains amongst other
things.
Worth nothing is that I'm not sure how widely this is supported. I know it's
supported in rollup, and there's been talk of it landing elsewhere too, but for
now it remains very much a transitional proposal so your favourite tool of
choice may ignore it.
It's also worth noting that even though not many utilities support this, not
many utils can utilise ES modules either so even in your Babel projects you're
going to be transpiling to CommonJS modules anyway. So this is an option.

<!--
So I've spoken very generally about ES modules, transpilers and bundlers, but
what about Node? Is there a native implementation in the pipeline?
The short answer is maybe, but the longer answer is that it's a contentious
issue and there's a lot of discussion going on about it.
I saw this tweet stream go through my window the other day and I thought it
highlighted various positions on the issue.
There's a bunch of issues around the Node implementation of ES modules, which I
haven't linked to from here because it feels a bit all over the place at the
moment. That said, V8 is getting module support, so eventually Node will have
something to  get started with.
-->
<section id="soooo">
    <h3>Soooo</h3>
    <p>Make a start! The tools are improving.<p>
    <p>Many of today's solutions transpile to CommonJS anyway</p>
    <p>You can get client-side performance benefits &amp; native ES6 with Rollup</p>
</section>
<!--
So that's pretty much it. What's the take-home from this?
Firstly definitely get started with publishing ES modules today.
Many of the big players are using them already (Aurelia I believe) so you don't
have to jump through hoops to get going. For those which aren't, you can
transpile for compatibility (if you care to). Keeping in mind most ES6 is
transpiled today anyway so this isn't so much of a big deal.
Overall, we're Javascript developers. We're used to the new big thing coming
in and pulling the rug out from under us. Thankfully as an ES standard, the
replacement is in it for the long haul.
